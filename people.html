                  <strong>Yingluck Shinawatra</strong> - nicknamed Pou - was
                  both the first female prime minister of Thailand following the
                  2011 election, and the youngest prime minister Thailand has
                  had in over 60 years.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                  In May of 2011, the Pheu Thai Party had nominated Yingluck as
                  their candidate in the election. After mass protests happened
                  against her government in 2013, she asked for a dissolution of
                  parliament on December 9th, 2013, which triggered a snap
                  election. On May 7th, 2014 Yingluck was removed from office by
                  the Constitutional Court of Thailand following the months of
                  political crisis.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                  After being removed from office, the court found her guilty of
                  abusing her power to remove Thawil Pliensri the national
                  security chief, which lead to her arrest along with former
                  cabinet ministers and political leaders who may have helped
                  her. Yingluck fled the country after this, and it is currently
                  unknown where specifically she is, but it is believed to be
                  somewhere in London or Serbia.

                  Srirasmi Suwadee. In 2016, the media labeled her as the king's
                  consort, despite the palace never declaring their
                  relationship.

                  promoted to the rank of general. She reached her rank after
                  only 6 years of service. In May 2019, Suthida was made Queen
                  of Thailand, with the marriage registration taking place at

                  <strong>Queen Sirikit</strong> is the queen mother of
                  Thailand. She was the Queen of Thailand, and is the mother of
                  the current King of Thailand - Vajiralongkorn. Sirikit was
                  appointed the queen regent in 1956, when the then king had
                  entered a Buddhist monkhood.

                  Even once the king was done with his period as a Buddhist
                  monk, Queen Sirikit was officially named the Regent of
                  Thailand due to her performing her duties so well. Sirikit was
                  the longest-reigning head of state, as well as the world's
                  longest-serving queen consort.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                  In 2012, Queen Sirikit started to feel ill, beginning to feel
                  unsteady and staggered while exercising at the Siriraj
                  Hospital, when it was discovered that she had undergone a
                  ischemic stroke - where blood fails to flow properly to the
                  brain, causing cell death. The queen was treated, but has not
                  made any public appearances since. In 2016, she was discharged
                  from the hospital and returned to the Royal Villa.
